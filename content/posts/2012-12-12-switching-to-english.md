It's been more than a year and a half since I started this blog and as every blog author, I haven't written as much as I wanted, but this has been a great year so far, with a lot of great things happening at work and in my personal life and I'm not a bit sorry for not having more time to blog.

So this blog post won't be about me promising that I'll blog more (or less :) it's an announcement that all future posts will be in English. This is a decision which I've made after some thinking and a lot of encouragement from friends and colleagues.

Expect a real blog post soon ;) and thanks for reading.
